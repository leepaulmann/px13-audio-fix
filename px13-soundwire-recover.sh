# PX13 - SoundWire audio recovery after s2idle resume.
# Runs as a transient unit (systemd-run) fired by the sleep hook
# /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/50-px13-soundwire - NEVER inline in the resume
# path, or the user session stays frozen (black screen) until it finishes.
#
# Method (validated 2026-07-30): FULL RELOAD of the SoundWire/ACP module stack.
# A shallow PCI unbind/bind does not work on kernel 7.1.5 - the slaves drop off
# the bus after s2idle and only a from-scratch re-enumeration brings them back.
#
#   - reload ALWAYS (even when Attached): the TAS2783 DSP firmware does not
#     survive s2idle and only a re-probe re-downloads it ("playback without fw
#     download" = silently muted amp);
#   - STOP the session's PipeWire FIRST, then unbind PCI -> rmmod stack
#     (children first) -> modprobe -> bind. Unloading the codec while userspace
#     still holds the ALSA card blocks forever in snd_card_disconnect_sync():
#     an unkillable D state that can only be cleared by a reboot (seen on
#     7.2.2, 2026-09-01). 7.1 tolerated restarting PipeWire afterwards; 7.2
#     does not;
#   - wait for Attached (up to 20 s);
#   - ALWAYS restart the session's PipeWire (a vanished card wedges the
#     WirePlumber graph and kills even Bluetooth audio - seen 2026-07-29);
#   - on success: reapply the HiFi profile and unmute the speaker (only becomes
#     the default sink if the current default is auto_null, so it never steals
#     from a Bluetooth headset).
#
# Nothing here is hardcoded to one PX13 SKU: the PCI address, the PipeWire card
# and the speaker sink are all probed (see lib/px13-detect.sh).
#
# Install: bash install-resume-recovery.sh
# Manual run: sudo /usr/local/lib/px13-soundwire-recover.sh

# Give the resume time to finish and the session to thaw before touching

# lands ~2 s after "PM: suspend exit", while the ACP is still settling, and it
# raced the driver's own teardown into a corrupted resource tree:
#
#   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000050
#   RIP: release_resource+0x34/0x80
#     platform_device_del <- platform_device_unregister <- pci_device_remove
#     <- device_release_driver_internal <- unbind_store   (7.1.9, 2026-09-05)
#
# release_resource() holds the global resource_lock for write, so the oops left
# it locked forever: every later GPU page fault (amdgpu_gem_fault -> ttm ->
# pfnmap_setup_cachemode -> walk_system_ram_range) spun on it and the whole
# desktop froze hard (soft lockups in quickshell and brave; only a power cycle
# cleared it). Roughly 1 resume in 10.
#
# On healthy resumes SoundWire re-enumeration does not even report in until
# ~t+7 s, so 10 s puts the teardown well clear of the resume path. Dropping the
# sysfs unbind would NOT help - modprobe -r snd_pci_ps runs the same
# pci_device_remove path. The lever is when, not how.
